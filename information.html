<i><ul><u><h>1.INTRODATION</h></ul></u></i>
<h>ELSA- (-demonstration), is an in-orbit demonstration (IOD) for d, which stands for End of Life Services by Astroscale
key end-of-life technology and capabilities of future debris removal missions. In Astroscale (AS), end-of-life (EOL) and active debris removal (ADR) have the following distinction: EOL
is concerned with removal of future entities that are launched
with a docking plate (DP) for semi-cooperative removal, whilst
ADR is concerned with removal of existing entities in space that
do not have a DP and are fully non-cooperative. ELSA-d, due
for launch in early 2020, consists of two spacecraft, a chaser
(~160 kg) and a target (~20 kg), launched stacked together. The
chaser is equipped with proximity rendezvous technologies and
a magnetic capture mechanism, whereas the target has a DP
which enables it to be captured. With the chaser repeatedly
releasing and capturing the target, a series of demonstrations
can be undertaken including: target search, target inspection,
target rendezvous, and both non-tumbling and tumbling capture.
ELSA-d is operated from the UK at the National In-orbit Servic.</h>
<i><ul><u><h> 2.MISSION OVERVEW</h></ul></u></i>
<h>The ELSA-d mission is an in-orbit demonstration that aims
to test several capabilities and technologies needed for future
services. The chaser and target can be seen in Figure 1, showing renditions for both docked and undocked configurations.
For the ELSA-d mission, the target, for convenience and massminimisation, is smaller relative to the chaser than a future EOL
or ADR mission. The target is also commandable, ensuring
demonstrations can be tested in a simplified manner earlier in
the mission. For example, before tumbling capture is attempted,
the easier case of non-tumbling capture is attempted which requires the target to hold a set attitude. Because the target is
launched with the chaser, the CONOPS can be designed such
that the complexity and risk increments gradually. This compares to a full service where the non-trivial task of finding the
target would be among the first mission actions.</h>
<i><ul><u><h1> 3.ROBOTIC MANINPULATUOR SYTEM ON SERVICING SATILLITE</h1></ul></u></i>
<h><h>Although recently there have been advances in relative space
navigation, the complex application of fully uncooperative rendezvous and capture for tumbling debris has not yet been attempted. The Autonomous Transfer Vehicle (ATV) was one of
the first times a spacecraft initiated and commenced a docking
manoeuvre in space in a fully autonomous mode [9]. The Engineering Test Satellite VII ‘KIKU-7’ (ETS-VII) by JAXA in
1997 was one of the first missions to demonstrate robotic rendezvous using chaser and target satellites [10]. The AoLong-1
(ADRV) ‘Roaming Dragon’ satellite was also recently launched
by CNSA (China National Space Administration) in 2016 in
order to test target capture with a robotic arm. Most recently,
JAXA’s HTV-6 vehicle, which launched in early 2017, unsuccessfully attempted to deploy an electrodynamic tether under
the Kounotori Integrated Tether Experiment (KITE) [11].
One of the core missions to test debris removal technologies
is RemoveDebris, launched in 2018, that aims to test a net,
harpoon, vision-based navigation and a dragsail in space - useful
payload technologies for future missions [12, 13]. Flight results
are expected later in 2018.
Upcoming smaller platforms to tackle debris removal include
CleanSpace One by EPFL, which aims to use microsatellites
with a grabber to demonstrate capture [14]. Airbus DS is working on a vehicle known as ‘The Cycler’ for mega-constellation
applications [15]. With regards to larger platforms, as mentioned
previously, ESA’s e.Deorbit (or surrounding CleanSpace activities) will likely result in a mission to remove a larger ESA-ownedobject. Some future missions are proposed to perform in-flight
repair or refueling, such as SSL’s RSGS mission for GEO and
Restore-L for LEO, both targeting the 2020 to 2021 timeframe.
ESS is also targeting GEO servicing with their ‘space drone’
docking system for demonstration in 2020.
It is believed that the ELSA-d mission will be an important
step towards fully operational EOL and ADR missions by maturing technologies and capabilities necessary for future services.
In particular, the ELSA-d mission will not just space-prove
future payload technologies, but will also go through almost
the full series of CONOPS expected in a full servicing mission with a demonstration target. The ELSA-d mission also
demonstrates capabilities including: integrated ground segment
to space segment interaction, rendezvous and docking in a safe
and autonomous manner, and demonstration of capture of a
tumbling target. For former ELSA-d information see [16, 17]</h></h>
<i><ul><u><h>1.KEY COMMERCIAL AND MISSION FACTOUR</h></ul></u></i>
<p>There were a range of key design factors for the ELSA-d
mission. Being in an immature commercial and legal market,
ELSA-d is a market leader in this domain. AS attempts to
engage in discussions with multiple parties to develop doctrine,
standards, and regulation critical to active debris removal. For
more information on Astroscale’s efforts in regulation and policy
see [18].</p>
<p>• AS is in discussions with the UK Space Agency (the mission licensing agency) to ensure a licensable chaser design</p>
<p>• AS is in preliminary discussions with UK insurance
providers to understand future insurance standards in inorbit servicing (IOS).</p>
<p>• AS is part of various standardisation and policydevelopment committees to ensure lessons learned are fed
into future doctrine and that ELSA-d and future missions
are in alignment with the future direction of policy.</p>
