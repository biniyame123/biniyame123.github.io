<h>Emerging plans for low Earth orbit (LEO)-based constellations featuring large numbers of satellites mean in the near future, space
populations could significantly increase. Systematic spacecraft end-of-life (EOL) management strategies assuring post-mission
disposal (PMD) are required to maintain utility of all LEO assets.
This paper will provide an overview of the ELSA-d EOL mission, Astroscale’s first semi-cooperative spacecraft retrieval technology
and capability demonstration mission, due for launch in 2020. ELSA-d consists of two spacecraft – a chaser and a target. The chaser
is equipped with proximity rendezvous technologies and a magnetic capture mechanism, whereas the target has a docking plate (DP)
which enables it to be captured.
Each phase of the main concept of operations (CONOPS) will be discussed and how these would align with future servicing
missions. Demonstrations include: target search, target inspection, target rendezvous, both non-tumbling and tumbling capture.
The preliminary satellite design will also be discussed with an outline of the core rendezvous, short and long-range navigation, and
capture technologies behind the mission.</h>
